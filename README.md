This project helps us to replace both name and content of files and folders (only applied for text file, not for binary file). 
And do other stuffs which maybe only me and god know what it is :D

Import into IntelliJ by gradle (you don't need to install gradle on your machine):
"File" > "New" > "Project from Existing Sources" > "Gradle" > Choose option "Use gradle wrapper task configuration" > Next...

Start application by running the file `ReplacingApplication.java`
